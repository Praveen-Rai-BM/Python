
Module 1:

Founder of PYTHON: Guido Van Rossum

How PYTHON name given: Guido wase reading the published scripts from 'Monty Pythons Flying Circus'Show in BBC Comedy series from the 1970s.He thought that PYTHON name was short.

Python 2 stopped in 2020.
Current Version Python 3.

High Level Language ---Python, Java , JS
Middle Level----C, C++
Low level----Assembly language (Mov addd Add)Bytecode
Machine level---Binary Code 010101 processor(Low voltage 0—High Voltage 1)

'Software' ---- is requied to break the High level to Machine level lnuage-'PYTHON Interpreter' (High level to Machine Level)
 
'C-Python' (Fastest PYTHON)

WHY PYTHON is called highg level programming language:

1) General Purpose-----we can develop any kind of software except OS.

2) Free and Open Source------Freely available and We can take the source coded and modify and use it for our own project requirments.

3) Compiler (C,C++/Line by Line code execution)–Interpreted Language (hidden compilation)

4) Portable language.

5) Procedure and Object Oriented Programming paradigm

Procedure Oriented-------Steps--Functions
Object Oriented----------Classes and Objects 

6) Dynamically Typed language:
 
'Statically Typed' ---C, C++
We have to specify the data type when we are declaring the variable, Int
Throught life of variable we cant change the data type
 
'Dynamically Typed' programming languges: PYTHON , Java Script
Data type is not specified at the time of declaration,
We can change datatype of variable
a="22"
a="Bangalore"
